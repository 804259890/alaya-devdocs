The LatticeX Foundation will release various ecological development plans open to the community from time to time. These programs provide a quick introduction to Alaya so that you can make contributions to Alaya and have the opportunity to receive rewards.

The LatticeX Foundation invites and encourages students, developers and enthusiasts to participate in the following programs:



### Developer Bounty Program

To encourage community developers to get more involved in the development and design of core infrastructure, the LatticeX Foundation has launched a developer bounty program to reward those who provide basic services for PlatON and Alaya.
