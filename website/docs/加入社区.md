### Forum

The vast majority of current conversations in Alaya, including implementation-related discussions, community support, and ecosystem news, take place in the following channels:

[Alaya Github](https://github.com/AlayaNetwork) - A repository of Alaya's core protocol code and open-source tools, as Alaya's main communication and implementation channel. 

[LatticeX Forum](https://forum.latticex.foundation/c/Alaya-CN/36) - The gathering place of various ideas and discussions on technical issues of Alaya and PlatON. 

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/PlatON_Network) - The gathering place of various ideas and discussions on technical issues of Alaya and PlatON. 

For long-term or complex discussions or technical support, it is recommended to use Github instead of a chat platform usually flooded with massive messages, which is not newcomer-friendly as well.
