## Abstact 

ARC-721 is a standard set of interfaces for issuing non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Alaya network and is fully compatible with [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

## ARC-721 Token Standard

ARC-721-compliant smart contracts must all implement the ARC721 and ARC165 interface, and can implement other extended interfaces according to business needs.

### ARC-721 & ARC-165 Interfaces             

```Solidity
interface ARC721 /* is ARC165 */ {
    //events
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);

    //required
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
    interface ARC165 {
        function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
    }

    //optional
    interface ARC721TokenReceiver {
        function onERC721Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _tokenId, bytes _data) external returns(bytes4);
    }

    interface ARC721Metadata {
        function name() external view returns (string _name);
        function symbol() external view returns (string _symbol);
        function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string);
    }

    interface ARC721Enumerable {
        function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
        function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);
        function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);
    }
}
```

### Required interfaces

- `balanceOf`: Count all NFTs assigned to an owner.
- `ownerOf`：Find the owner of an NFT.
- `safeTransferFrom`：Transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address.
- `transferFrom`：Transfer ownership of an NFT -- THE CALLER IS RESPONSIBLE.
- `approve`：Change or reaffirm the approved address for an NFT.
- `setApprovalForAll`：Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage.
- `getApproved`：Get the approved address for a single NFT.
- `isApprovedForAll`：Query if an address is an authorized operator for another address.
- `supportsInterface`：Query if a contract implements an interface.

### Optionally interfaces

- `onERC721Received`：Handle the receipt of an NFT. If you need to make a secure transfer inside the contract, you must implement the ARC721TokenReceiver interface.
- `name`：A descriptive name for a collection of NFTs in this contract.
- `symbol`：An abbreviated name for NFTs in this contract.
- `tokenURI`：A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema". This is the “ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema” referenced above.：
  ```JSON
  {
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
        },
        "image": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
        }
    }
  }
  ```
- `totalSupply`：Count NFTs tracked by this contract.
- `tokenByIndex`：Enumerate valid NFTs.
- `tokenOfOwnerByIndex`：Enumerate NFTs assigned to an owner.

### Event

- Transfer：This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.
- Approval：This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or.
- ApprovalForAll：This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner.

## Example

ARC-721 standard is fully compatible with ERC-721, examples are available [here](https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-erc721).

## View Token

You can view ARC20 Token and transaction history in [Alaya Explorer](https://scan.alaya.network/tokens/tokensTranfer/arc721) and [ATON Wallet](/alaya-devdocs/en/ATON_user_manual/).

## Contract Deployment

Please refer to [Solidity Getting started](/alaya-devdocs/en/Solidity_Getting_started).

## Method call

Here's an example of how to call a contract method using the Python SDK.

### Install the dependencies

Use the following command to install the `python library`, Python version 3.7.5+ is recommended:

``` shell
pip install client-sdk-python
```

During the installation process, some dependency packages will require `c++14` compilation, please download [cppbuildtools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126) after you see the relevant prompt, use the default value to install it, and then re-execute the pip install command.

### Instantiation

``` python
from client_sdk_python import Web3, HTTPProvider

rpc, chain_id, hrp = 'http://127.0.0.1:6789', 201030, 'ATP'
w3 = Web3(HTTPProvider(rpc), chain_id=chain_id, hrp_type=hrp)
abi = [
  {
    "inputs": [
      {"internalType": "string", "name": "_name", "type": "string"},
      {"internalType": "string", "name": "_symbol", "type": "string"}
	],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "constructor"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [
      {"internalType": "address", "name": "_to", "type": "address"},
      {"internalType": "uint256", "name": "_tokenId", "type": "uint256"},
      {"internalType": "string", "name": "_uri", "type": "string"}
	],
    "name": "mint",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [{"internalType": "address", "name": "_owner", "type": "address"}],
    "name": "balanceOf",
    "outputs": [{"internalType": "uint256", "name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [{"internalType": "uint256", "name": "_tokenId", "type": "uint256"}],
    "name": "ownerOf",
    "outputs": [{"internalType": "address", "name": "_owner", "type": "address"}],
    "stateMutability": "view",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "inputs": [
	  {"internalType": "address", "name": "_from", "type": "address"},
      {"internalType": "address", "name": "_to", "type": "address"},
      {"internalType": "uint256", "name": "_tokenId", "type": "uint256"}
	],
    "name": "safeTransferFrom",
    "outputs": [],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
    "type": "function"
  },
  {
    "anonymous": false,
    "inputs": [
      {"indexed": true, "internalType": "address", "name": "_from", "type": "address"},
      {"indexed": true, "internalType": "address", "name": "_to", "type": "address"},
      {"indexed": true, "internalType": "uint256", "name": "_tokenId", "type": "uint256"}
	],
    "name": "Transfer",
    "type": "event"
  },
]
arc721 = w3.eth.contract(address='contract address', abi=abi)
print([func for func in arc721.functions])
print([event for event in arc721.events])
```

### Query Contract Information

The following is an example of `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, other query methods are similar to this.

``` python
# Count all NFTs assigned to an owner
arc721.functions.balanceOf('your address').call()
# Find the owner of an NFT
arc721.functions.ownerOf('your token id').call()
```

### Sending a contract transaction
The following is an example of a `safeTransferFrom` call.

``` python
# Transferring ownership of NFT from one address to another
tx = {
    'chainId': w3.chain_id,
    'nonce': w3.eth.getTransactionCount('your address'),
    'gas': 4012388,
    'value': 0,
    'gasPrice': 1000000000,
}
txn = arc721.functions.safeTransferFrom(_from='your address', _to='to address', _tokenId='your token id').buildTransaction(tx)
signed_txn = w3.eth.account.signTransaction(txn, private_key='your private key')
tx_hash = w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction).hex()
receipt = w3.eth.waitForTransactionReceipt(tx_hash)
```

###  Get contract events

As an example of a transfer transaction event.

``` python
events = arc721.events.Transfer().processReceipt(receipt)
```

## Upload Metadata to IPFS network

`Metadata` is the details of the NFT token, whis is stored under the chain. We usually need to specify a URI path as the Metadata data for an NFT token when we issue it.

### 1. Install IPFS

Please refer to the [IPFS documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/command-line/) installation and startup.

### 2. Upload the File

Upload an picture with the name `Alaya.jpeg` to the ipfs node.

```
$ ipfs add Alaya.jpeg
```
If the above command runs successfully it will output the file ID, as follows.

```Text
added QmZtmD2qt6fJot32nabSP3CUjicnypEBz7bHVDhPQt9aAy Alaya.jpeg
``` 
### 3. Verify that the picture can be downloaded
Open the following link of the picture in the browser, you can see the picture indicating that the picture can be downloaded successfully:
<https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZtmD2qt6fJot32nabSP3CUjicnypEBz7bHVDhPQt9aAy?filename=Alaya.jpeg>

### 4. Construct the NFT metadata file

Next you can use the image link above to construct `Metadata` for NFT.

Create a JSON file according to the metadata example in the ARC-721 document and name it alaya.json, and replace the description value in the image field with the BTFS download link of the image above, as shown in the figure:
```
{
    "name":"Alaya.jpg",
    "author":"Alaya",
    "description":"use for arc721",
    "image":"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZtmD2qt6fJot32nabSP3CUjicnypEBz7bHVDhPQt9aAy?filename=Alaya.jpeg"
}
```

Run the following command to upload alaya.json
```
$ ipfs add alaya.json
```
You can get the file ID after uploading, as follows：
```
added QmQXqTVCb1w7CmdsYxHWR1T1qyaCHHgWwiPmoZDcQL39Px alaya.json
```

Open the URI of the metadata file in the browser:
<https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQXqTVCb1w7CmdsYxHWR1T1qyaCHHgWwiPmoZDcQL39Px?filename=alaya.json>

If the Metadata information is displayed in the browser, it means the file was uploaded successfully.
